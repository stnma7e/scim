Revamped game engine in C++

----

This app uses libglfw and libGLEW for OpenGL rendering, so in order to compile it, you must have these libraries installed on your system. A OpenGL implementation of version 2.4 and GLSL version 1.2 are also required.

The external dependency will be changed in the future.
