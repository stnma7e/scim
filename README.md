Revamped game engine in C++

----

This app uses libglfw and libGLEW for OpenGL rendering, so in order to compile it, you must have these libraries installed on your system. A OpenGL implementation of version 2.1 and GLSL version 1.2 is also required. Unit tests are run by UnitTest++. To build the test target this is needed.

All external libraries are open source and included in the 'dep' directory.

The external dependency will be changed in the future.
